# Save Game Backup Tool

A Python application for easily backing up, managing, and restoring video game save files across your computer.

## üéÆ Overview

The Save Game Backup Tool is a command-line utility designed to help gamers create and manage backups of their save game files. Never lose your progress again by maintaining organized backups that can be easily restored when needed.

To launch the tool in GUI mode:
```
python Game_Save_backup_script.py --gui
```

Or select "G. Switch to GUI Mode" from the command-line menu.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The tool now uses a configuration file (`config.ini`) that is automatically created on first run. You can easily customize:

- **Backup Location**: The directory where all game backups will be stored
- **URL Settings**: Links to external resources like SaveGame.pro

On first launch, the tool will create a default `config.ini` file in the same directory as the script. You can edit this file with any text editor to customize your settings.

Example `config.ini` file:
```ini
[PATHS]
base_backup_location = C:\save game

[URLS]
savegame_pro_url = https://savegame.pro/
```
